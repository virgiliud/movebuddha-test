# Dice Money Child Theme

To compile the Tailwind CSS for this child theme:

1. Run `npm install` to pull dependencies.
2. Execute `npm run build` to generate the stylesheet in `assets/build/style.css`.
3. For watch mode while developing, run `npm run dev`.

Ensure the parent Dice theme is active and then activate this child theme in WordPress.
